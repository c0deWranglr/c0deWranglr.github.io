title: My Perspective

I subscribe to evolutionary theory. As such, I believe that we are animals just like many of the other living organisms on the planet. All living things have evolved to be specialized in ways that allow them to thrive. Obvious examples are the cheetah's mastery of speed to help catch prey and insect eating plants. For us, it is our intellectual abilities that appear to be the differentiating factor. We have the ability to solve very difficult problems. We have been able to take advantage of our surroundings in a way that has propogated our species across the planet. It's no wonder that we may feel much different from the rest of the living creatures here. I mean, there are no currently living animals that are even close to being able to do what we can. Some may wonder if we are in a class above the rest. However, we share many of the same folleys as the rest of the animals. We get hungry, tired, fatigued. We have weakness and limitations. None of this is bad though, in fact, I think it's important. It's important to understand weakness in order for us to make progress. This is probably the most important aspect of our species to me. We can reflect, make change and try again.

That is my general perspective toward life and perspectives are important. They are the basis for any action we take. They are, however, not unique nor original. Most, if not all, we know comes by way of other people. With most of our thoughts not being novel, how have we progressed so far as a species? I think it’s actually for this exact reason. The more we can learn complex ideas and behaviors from others, the more time we have to spend contemplating the unsolved. 

This is the purpose of this writing. Not to explain some novel idea, but as a reference to come back to when my perspective needs refreshing. Allowing me time to spend focusing on personal betterment and refining my craft. I hope for this to be a growing catalog of interpretations/perspectives gained in my lifetime. As I learn more, I plan to update this document with new perspectives. This is intended to be the appendix to my life. Each topic is meant to be brief and easy to consume. No sugar coating or distracting stories, just on point explanations. Enough said, let’s jump in.

# Fairness
Fairness is merely a social construct. The outside world that we call nature doesn't care about being fair. If something can be done, then it is free game to do so (from nature's point of view). Why then would we create the abstract idea of freedom? My interpretation is simple: we work most effectively together. That's how we've come to accomplish such unimaginable feats; we work together.

We are all born with different attributes. Somethings come easier to some and harder to others. However, people can also develop abilities and strengths. There has been much research done on this topic and I don't need to repeat all that I've read. Suffice it to say that no matter what attributes you are born with, you can learn, change and develop new abilities. Now, what fairness (as a social construct) does is allow us to create a level starting ground for each individual to develop their abilities. This benefits society by allowing the best to arise from the masses in all areas; furthering our progress and evolution as a species. 

The definition of fairness is always evolving. I welcome the evolution. We need to learn from our mistakes and make adjustments. Sometimes, however, I think we confuse fairness for equality. We are not the same people. Our performances are not equal. Not everyone should get a trophy just for trying something. That doesn't mean that I don't believe in positive reinforcement (which I do). There is only one NBA champion every year after all. NBA players are rewarded with contracts for their performance even without the championship ring though. Almost always this is in hopes that they can continue to develop and help the team elevate to that level over time. 

# Bias

# Truth
Truth is a complicated topic. Some people dedicate much of their time to understand truth from fiction. While objective truths exist, it is hard (or maybe even impossible), to know what they are. I think there are two ways to deal with the problem of truth finding:
1. Provide evidence of the truth
2. Otherwise, declare that truth can't actually be known and go about my day not worrying about it

Adhering only to #1 just leads to a preoccupation with evidence. Which, in my opinion, is an unhealthy way to live. I would personally rather accomplish something with that time. The problem with #2 is that it leads to inaction. If nothing can be known, then what's the point of anything really? 

My preferred way of handling truth is to follow conclusive evidence if it exists. If it doesn't, then don't worry too much about it. Continue living life following after the things we are most certain of. No need to have a preoccupation declaring everything as fact vs fiction. If the evidence isn't sufficiently conclusive then move on. 

What is sufficiently conclusive though? Unfortunately that's where opinions rear their head. What one person thinks is acceptable evidence may be unacceptable to another. I think the decision of what is an acceptable threshold for evidence is an important one, though. Personally, my yard stick is whether or not another possiblity can exist or not. If an alternative cannot exist, then, to me, this is truth. If it can exist, then it is merely a belief/opinion.

# Belief
A belief dictates pretty much everything to do with our life. It's the basis for our perspective on the world. Beliefs aid in giving purpose to the things we do. Since, if we believe the world is such and such way, then our actions follow. I've heard people say that they believe in things, yet they don't follow the things they profress to believe. I think what these people are referring to is not belief at all. I'm not saying we have to perfectly align our actions with our beliefs, but belief does drive action. 

I think what these people are describing is a mind that isn't made up on what to believe. If your mind is playing in the middle of multiple belief systems, then what do you do? It's often overwhelming and easily leads to inaction. The lack of action is still action nonetheless. I think it's important to admit the lack of firmness in belief and then work to understand ourselves. The more we understand ourselves, the less we have to play in the middle of various conflicting belief systems.

I understand that it often takes a while before someone can hold firm to a belief system. This isn't a bad thing. It's also not bad to let beliefs shift and change. Change is inevitable, no sense in fighting it. We must, however, also acknowledge that any belief system has contradictions. Understanding these contradictions is enlightening. Regardless, our perspective is derived from belief. 

As I said in the intro: I subscribe to evolutionary theory. Much of my beliefs are built off of that. I think nature is incredible. The innate desire for all living creatures to survive is facinating. For example, life evolves to best suite the environment in which it lives in. Even in the habits that we (our species of Human) have destroyed, life is able to thrive when left alone. These are patterns of life that I have built my belief system around.  I believe it is our our responsibility to make a minimal impact on the planet. If it can be done sustainably, then do it. If it can't, then don't. It's really that simple in my mind. 

As follows with the desire to survive, we desire to avoid pain. Pain may just be a signal from the brain, but I think it's generally helpful. This must be why we call life "The Search For Happiness". It's important to me that I live without causing pain to others. To some extent this is impossible - we can't make everyone happy. However, we can strive in our relationships and interactions with others to limit doing things of known harm. If we don't know what those things are, then talk about it with them. We are in this together for the long haul. I'll discuss more about pain in the section on Happiness.

In the end, we probably won't follow our beliefs perfectly. We are all learning as we go. We do, however, have the ability to evaluate our actions and behavior. This gives us a fantastic opportunity to learn and try again. Never stop trying. We can reach profound heights by fighting weakness head on and improving each day. Act, review and act again. This is the key.

# Meaning/Purpose
What is the meaning of life? Does it really matter? I tend to not worry too much about purpose. Purpose, to me, is just a natural derivative of belief. I think nature is incredible. Here are a few patterns that I've observed:
1. Animals evolve to adapt best to their environment
2. When left alone, nature has a way of rebuilding destroyed habitats
3. Every animal has a instinctual desire to survive

It's my opinion that we should follow these same patterns. We each learn and grow through our lives. We have the ability to evaluate our actions and behavior. This gives us a fantastic opportunity to learn and try again. Never stop trying. We can reach profound heights by fighting weakness head on and improving each day. Act, review and act again. This is the key.

I also believe it is our responsibility to make a minimal impact on the planet. If it can be done sustainably, then do it. If it can't, then don't. It's really that simple in my mind. 

I think the desire to survive is one of the few instincts we are born with. We desire to avoid pain, even if pain is just a signal of the mind. This must be why we call life "The Search For Happiness". This is why it is my perspective that life is best lived when without causing pain to others. To some extent this is impossible - we can't make everyone happy. However, we can strive in our relationships and interactions with others to limit doing things of known harm. If we don't know what those things are, then talk about it with them. We are in this together for the long haul.

# Happiness
Happiness occurs when expectations align with reality. It follows that the more expectations we have, the harder it would be to enjoy a constant state of happiness. 
I have found that I generally have less pain when I have less to worry about. It is easy and tempting to fill our lives with all sorts of stuff to worry about. 

# Good vs Bad
Is there such thing as something being objectively good or objectively bad? Are good and bad opposites or is it more of a spectrum? 

# Responsibility

# Expectations

# Change
