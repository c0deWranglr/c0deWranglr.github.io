# Intro
Perspectives are important. They are the basis for any action we take. They are, however, not unique. There are very few things, if any, that are instinctual. Most, if not all, we know comes from other people. Very few of our ideas are actually novel. If this is the case, how have we progressed so far as a species? I think it’s actually for this exact reason. The more we can learn complex ideas and behaviors from others, the more time we have to spend contemplating the unsolved. This is why I am writing. Not to explain some novel idea, but as a reference to come back to when my perspective needs refreshing. Allowing me time to spend focusing on personal betterment and refining my craft. 

I hope for this to be a growing catalog of interpretations/perspectives gained in my lifetime. This is intended for this to be the appendix to my life views. Each topic is meant to be brief and easy to consume. No sugar coating or distracting stories, just on point explanations. It is also a living resource. I learn new things all the time, just like you. I hope whomever comes across this may find some useful perspective within that enriches their life. With that said, let’s jump in.
